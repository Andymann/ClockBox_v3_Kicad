<br>
Findings:<br>
-connector for WS2812B needs more space to hold a terminal block<br>
-Position of Arduino needs to be changed to not need extra cabling<br>
-3.5mm jacks need to lap over the edge of the board to accomodate for case wall<br>
-3.5mm jacks need to be seperated to make it visually easier to identify<br>
-connectors for buttons need to be moved to allow for better labeling<br>
-pulldown resistors are actually not necessary<br>
-design pcb to have a break-off part as an underlay for led-stripe<br>
